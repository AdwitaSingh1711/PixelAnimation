- [Piskel](https://www.piskelapp.com/) → sprite sheet assembly
- HTML/CSS → animations

## Usage  
Each Pokémon sprite animation is organized by folder name (e.g., `Sylveon/`, `Ralts/`, `Litwick/`). Inside each folder you’ll find:  

- A **sprite sheet** (`.png`)  
- Any **supporting assets** (like shadows)  
- Example **HTML/CSS** files showing how the animation works  

You can use these in your own projects by:  
1. Copy the folder of the Pokémon you want.  
2. Linking the sprite sheet in your project’s HTML/CSS, for example:  
3. Adjusting the CSS animation speed and frame count depending on the sprite sheet.  

This way, you can drop any of the Pokémon sprites into websites, fan projects, or personal experiments.
